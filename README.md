Functional heapless binary parser language I'm making for myself.
Check out [the documentation](/doc/intro.md) or the [playground](https://yabo-lang.org/) if you're curious, although the language and compiler are still in rough shape.
There's also a tool at `tools/ylliab` that lets you explore the parsed binary.
